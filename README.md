Validated only the create form. Maybe update the rest later.

-Todos:
    - Add more validation
        - Add validation to sign up with a cofirmPassword and validate using custom validation
    - Fix message timestamp
    - Add Admin update system (upgrade membership button next to logout)-> current user turns to admin
    (basic, so we can't delete messages or create but we see username, timestampe)
    (admin can delete messages)
    -> member page and admin page?
